# ✨ App Cleaned & Ready!

## 🧹 What Was Removed

### Default Vite/React Branding
- ❌ `vite.svg` - Removed
- ❌ `react.svg` - Removed  
- ❌ `App.css` with logo styles - Removed
- ❌ Default index.css styles - Replaced with Tailwind
- ❌ Default App.tsx with logos - Replaced with routing

### What Was Added
- ✅ Clean routing setup
- ✅ Authentication pages
- ✅ Tailwind CSS styling

- ✅ Professional title and meta tags

## 🎯 Current State

Your app is now **100% clean** with:
- No React logos
- No Vite logos
- No default branding
- Professional authentication UI
- Ready to use!

## 🚀 To Run

```bash
cd frontend/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open: **http://localhost:3000**

You'll see the **Login Page** - no logos, just your clean auth UI!

## 📁 Note About Directory Structure

You have two frontend directories:
- `frontend/` - Root with docs and config
- `frontend/frontend/` - Actual app (this is where you run `npm run dev`)

This is normal if you created the Vite project inside the frontend folder.
